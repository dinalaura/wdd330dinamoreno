Objects <br>
<br>
JavaScript has six primitive data types: <br>
<br>
Strings, numbers, booleans, symbols, undefined, and null or an object. <br>
An object in JavaScript is a self-contained set of related values and functions. <br>
If a property’s value is a function, it is known as a method.  <br>
<br>
Example of an object literal: <br>
<br>
const superman = { <br>
name: 'Superman', <br>
'real name': 'Clark Kent', <br>
height: 75, <br>
weight: 235, <br>
hero: true, <br>
villain: false, <br>
allies: ['Batman','Supergirl','Superboy'], fly() {  <br>
    <br>
return 'Up, up and away!'; }  <br>
<br>
}; <br>
<br>
Each property is a key-value pair, separated by commas.  <br>
<br>
All objects are mutable, meaning that its properties and methods can be changed or removed,<br>
 and new properties and methods can be added to the object, even if it was declared using const. <br>
 <br>
To create an object literal, simply enter a pair of curly braces.  <br>
Empty object: <br>
const spiderman = {};<br> 
Object using a constructor function: <br>
const spiderman = new Object(); <br>
Literal notation is recommended. <br>
<br>
You can access the properties of an object using the dot notation. <br>
That will return the value of that property: <br>
<br>
superman.name << 'Superman' <br>
You can also access an object’s properties using bracket notation using quote marks: <br>
superman['name'] << 'Superman' <br>
If you try to access a property that doesn’t exist, undefined will be returned: <br>
superman.city << undefined <br>
<br>
To call an object’s method use dot or bracket notation. Calling a method is the same as invoking a function,<br>
so parentheses need to be placed after the method name:  <br>
<br>
superman.fly() <br>
<< 'Up, up and away!'  <br>
<br>
superman['fly']() <br>
<< 'Up, up and away!' <br>
<br>
The in operator can be used to check whether an object has a particular property: <br>
'city' in superman;  <br>
<< false <br>
Check to see if the property or method doesn’t return undefined: <br>
superman.city !== undefined; <br>
 << false <br>
 <br>
The hasOwnProperty() can be used to check whether an object has a property that is its own, <br>
rather than one that has been inherited from another object: <br>
superman.hasOwnProperty('city');  <br>
<< false  <br>
superman.hasOwnProperty('name');  <br>
<< true <br>
<br>
We can loop through all an object’s properties and methods by using a for in loop: <br>
for(const key in superman) { console.log(key + ": " + superman[key]); }  <br>
<<  "name: Superman"  <br>
<<  "real name: Clark Kent"<br>  
<<  "height: 75"  <br>
<<  "weight: 235"  <br>
<<  "hero: true"  <br>
<<  "villain: false"  <br>
<<  "allies: Batman,Supergirl,Superboy"  <br>
<<  "fly: function (){  <br>
console.log(\"Up, up and away!\"); }" <br>
<br>

The Object.keys() method will return an array of all the keys of any object that is provided as an argument. <br>
We can then iterate over this array to access all the keys of an object:  <br>
for(const key of Object.keys(superman)) {  <br>
console.log(key); <br>
} <br>
<< name  <br>
real  <br>
name <br>
height <br>
weight <br>
hero <br>
villain <br>
allies <br>
fly <br>
<br>
ES2017 also adds some the Object.values() that works in the same way but returns an array of all the object’s value.<br>
Object.entries() is also part of ES2017 and returns an array of key-value pairs. <br>
These key-value pairs are returned in arrays.<br> 
<br>
New properties and methods can be added to objects at any time in a program. <br>
This is done by simply assigning a value to the new property: <br>
superman.city = 'Metropolis'; <br>
 << 'Metropolis' <br>
Properties don’t always appear in the order they were entered. <br>
<br>
Changing the value of an object’s properties, we can change the value of the "real name" property like this: <br>
superman['real name'] = 'Kal-El';  <br>
<< 'Kal-El' <br>
Also, any property can be removed from an object using the delete operator: <br>
delete superman.fly  <br>
<< true <br>
<br>
It’s even possible for an object to contain other objects. These are known as nested objects. <br>
const jla = { <br>
superman: { realName: 'Clark Kent' }, <br>
batman: { realName: 'Bruce Wayne' }, <br>
wonderWoman: { realName: 'Diana Prince" },<br>
 flash: { realName: 'Barry Allen' }, <br>
 aquaman: { realName: 'Arthur Curry' }, <br>
} <br>
<br>
The values in nested objects can be accessed by referencing each property name <br>
in order using either dot or bracket notation: <br>
jla.wonderWoman.realName  <br>
<< "Diana Prince"  <br>
jla['flash']['realName']<br> 
 << "Barry Allen" <br>
Accessing with mix notation:<br> 
jla.aquaman['realName'] <br>
 << "Arthur Curry" <br>
 <br>
An object literal can be passed as a parameter to a function. This is useful when there are many parameters: <br>
function greet({greeting,name,age}) { <br>
return `${greeting}! My name is ${name} and I am ${age}  <br>
➥ years old.`; } <br>
<br>
This:<br>  
The keyword this refers to the object that it is within. <br>
It can be used inside methods to gain access to the object’s properties. <br>
There six different ways where this can take on new values. <br>
They are: <br>
    this in global context <br>
    this in object construction<br> 
    this in an object method <br>
    this in a simple function <br>
    this in an arrow function <br>
    this in an event listener <br>
    <br>
Naming collisions occur when the same variable or function name is used for different purposes<br>
 by code sharing the same scope. A solution to this problem is to use the object literal pattern to <br>
 create a namespace for groups of related functions. This is done by creating an object literal <br>
 that serves as the namespace, then adding any values as properties of that object, and any functions as methods.<br> 
 <br>
 JSON<br>  
JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON, was invented by Douglas Crockford in 2001.<br>
It is a lightweight data-storage format. It is often used to exchange information between web services. <br>
JSON is a string representation of the object literal notation that we have just seen. <br>
There are, however, a couple of key differences:  <br>
    Property names must be double-quoted  <br>
    Permitted values are double-quoted strings, numbers, true, false, null, arrays  <br>
    and objects  <br>
    Functions are not permitted values  <br>
    <br>
A JSON string representation the Caped Crusader is shown below: <br>
const batman = '{"name": "Batman","real name": "Bruce <br>
➥ Wayne","height": 74, "weight": 210, "hero": true, "villain": ➥ false, "allies": ["Robin","Batgirl","Superman"]}' <br>
<br><br>
Document Object Model <br>
The Document Object Model (DOM) allows you to access elements of a web page <br>
and enable interaction with the page by adding and removing elements, changing the order,<br>
content and attributes of elements, and even altering how they are styled. <br>
<br>
The Document Object Model, or DOM for short, represents an HTML document <br>
as a network of connected nodes that form a tree-like structure. The DOM treats <br>
everything on a web page as a node. The HTML tag is the root node, and every <br>
other part of the document is a child node of this. <br>
<br>
The DOM is not actually part of JavaScript because it is language agnostic. <br>
This means it can be used in any programming language, not just JavaScript. <br>
We can use JavaScript to access and modify different parts of a web page <br>
using a special built-in object called document. <br>
<br>
The DOM provides several methods that allow us to access any element on a page.<br>
These objects can then be assigned to a variable and be inspected or modified: <br>
const body = document.body; <br>
<br>
All nodes have a numerical code to signify what type they are. <br>
These are summmarized in the table below. <br>
Code Type  <br>
1  element  <br>
2  attribute  <br>
3  text  <br>
8  comment  <br>
9  body <br>
<br>
The getElementById() method does exactly what it says on the title. <br>
It returns a reference to the element with a unique id attribute that is given as an argument: <br>
const h1 = document.getElementById('title'); <br>
The document.querySelector() method allows you to use CSS notation to find <br>
the first element in the document that matches a CSS selector provided as an argument. <br>
If no elements match, it will return null. <br>
the following could be used instead of document.getElementById(): <br>
document.querySelector('#bats'); << < li class="vigilante hero"  <br>
➥ id="bats">Batman</ li > <br>
<br>
The setAttribute can change the value of an element’s attributes. <br>
It takes two arguments: the attribute that you wish to change, <br>
and the new value of that attribute. <br>
wonderWoman.setAttribute('class', 'villain'); << undefined  <br>
wonderWoman.getAttribute('class'); << "villain" <br>
<br>
<br>
Events<br> 
The DOM is an interface that allows you to use JavaScript to interact with a web page. <br>
Events are another part of the DOM and they are what provides the link between<br>
 the web page and user interactions. Every time a user interacts with a web page, <br>
 such as clicking on a link, pressing a key, or moving a mouse, an event occurs <br>
 that our program can detect and then respond to. <br>
 <br>
Event listeners are like setting a notification to alert you when something happens. <br>
Instead of the program having to constantly check to see if an event has occurred, <br>
the event listener will let it know when the event happens, and the program can then <br>
respond appropriately. <br>
<br>
JavaScript uses a non-blocking approach that uses event listeners to listen out <br>
for any clicks on the page: <br>
document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething); <br>
<br>
<br>
The following is part of the code of the game in the textbook,<br>
 in this code the variables are set, and then the program access the DOM <br>
 with query selectors and getting elements by id: <br>
 <br>
const quiz = [ <br>

              { name: "Superman",realName: "Clark Kent" }, <br>

              { name: "Wonderwoman",realName: "Dianna Prince" }, <br>

              { name: "Batman",realName: "Bruce Wayne" }, <br>

            ]; <br>
            <br>
// View Object <br>
<br>
const view = { <br>
  score: document.querySelector('#score strong'), <br>
  question: document.getElementById('question'), <br>
  result: document.getElementById('result'), <br>
  info: document.getElementById('info'), <br>
  render(target,content,attributes) { <br>
      for(const key in attributes) { <br>
        <br>
        target.setAttribute(key, attributes[key]); <br>
        <br>
      } <br>
      <br>
      target.innerHTML = content; <br>
      <br>
  } <br>
  <br>
}; <br>
