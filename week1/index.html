    This week I learned about UX. When creating an app, you may want to design for small <br>
    and less powerful devices and focus on the content. I realized how I used to have just one device, <br>
    a desktop computer, but now I manipulate more computers and phones (The paradigm shift).<br>
    Developers must think about many different screen sizes when working on a project. <br>
    <br>
    When developing a mobile user experience, the developer must reduce steps, as much as <br>
    possible, for the user to keep using the app and take care of the reachability and speed of the app. <br>
    Speed can improve when optimizing images, CSS, JS, and using SVG. <br>
    <br>
    When working on mobile devices, frequently used menus work better on the bottom part <br>
    of the app. Make simple forms, use autofill, and number keypad when needed. Make <br>
    advertisements small for browsing on mobile; stop using pop-ups and use the content first. <br>
    <br>
    I learned in the virtual lab about local storage, as well as doing stuff with web things. <br>
    A function may be used to save in the local storage and use it in a program. <br>
    <br>
    And example from the book: <br>
    <br>
    function loadStory(){ <br>
    var storyName = document.getElementById(“name_input”).value <br>
    var storyHTML = localStorage.getItem(storyName) document.getElementById(“story_editor”).value = storyHTML <br>
    10 } <br>
    <br>
    I also learned how to set my portfolio, and this is the code from it. <br>
    <br>
    const links = [{ <br>
    label: "Week1 notes", <br>
    url: "week1/index.html" <br>
    }, <br>
    <br>
    { <br>
    label: "Week2 notes", <br>
    url: "week2/index.html" <br>
    } <br>
    ] <br>
    <br>
    const myList = document.querySelector("ol"); <br>
    <br>
    links.forEach(links => { <br>

    let item = document.createElement("li"); <br>

    let anchor = document.createElement("a"); <br>

    anchor.setAttribute("href", links.url); <br>

    anchor.innerText = links.label; <br>

    <br>

    item.appendChild(anchor); <br>

    myList.appendChild(item); <br>

    }); <br>

    <br>
  </p>
