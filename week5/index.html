    Testing and Debugging <br>
    <br>
    Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings  <br>
    Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused by one of the following:<br>
    System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.  <br>
    Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo. <br>
    User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle. <br>
    Programmers have little influence over how external systems work. Despite this, <br>
    we should still be aware of them and attempt to reduce their impact by working around any problems they cause. <br>
    Programmer errors are our responsibility, so we must ensure they are minimized as much as possible and fixed promptly <br>
    <br>
    Exceptions <br>
    An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error. <br>
    <br>
    Stack Traces <br>
    An exception will also produce a stack trace. This is a sequence of functions or method calls <br>
    that lead to the point where the error occurred. A stack trace will work backwards<br>
    from the point at which the error occurred to identify the original function or method that started the sequence. <br>
    How stack trace can help you find where an error originates from: <br>
    <br>
    function three(){ unicorn(); <br>
    } function two(){ three(); <br>
    } function one(){ two(); <br>
    } one();  <br>
    < < index.html:13 Uncaught ReferenceError: unicorn is ➥ not defined  <br>
    at three (index.html:13) at two (index.html:17) at one (index.html:21) at index.html:24` <br>
    <br>
    Warnings <br>
    A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn’t enough to cause the program to crash. <br>
    An example of a mistake that could cause a warning is assigning a value to a variable that’s undeclared: <br>
    pi = 3.142; <br>
    << JavaScript Warning: assignment to undeclared  <br>
    ➥ variable <br>
    <br>
    The Importance of Testing and Debugging <br>
    JavaScript is a fairly forgiving language when it comes to errors; <br>
    it didn’t implement exceptions at all until ECMAScript version 3. Instead of alerting a user to an error in a program,<br>
    it just failed silently in the background. <br>
    <br>
    Strict Mode <br>
    ECMAScript 5 introduced a strict mode that produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features. <br>
    Writing code in strict mode can also help improve its clarity and speed, since it follows conventions <br>
    and will throw exceptions if any sloppy code practices are used. <br>
    Strict mode simply requires the following string to be added to the first line of a JavaScript file: <br>
    <br>
    'use strict'; <br>
    <br>
    To see it in action, if you try to assign a value to a variable that is undeclared in strict mode, <br>
    you’ll get an exception, instead of a warning: <br>
    'use strict'; <br>
    e = 2.718; <br>
    << ReferenceError: e is not defined <br>
    <br>
    The recommended way to invoke strict mode is to place all your code into a self-invoking function: <br>
    <br>
    (function() { 'use strict';  <br>
    // All your code would go inside this function }());  <br>
    <br>
    Linting Tools <br>
    Linting tools such as JS Lint, JS Hint, and ES Lint can be used to test the quality of JavaScript code, <br>
    beyond simply using strict mode. They are designed to highlight any sloppy programming practices or <br>
    syntax errors, and will complain if certain style conventions are not followed, such as how code is indented.<br>
    <br>
    Feature Detection <br>
    Browser vendors are constantly adding support for these new features, but they don’t always keep up. <br>
    What’s more, some browsers will support certain features and others won’t. You can’t always rely on<br>
    users having the most up-to-date browser, either.  <br>
    <br>
    The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use feature detection. <br>
    This is done using an if statement to check whether an object or method exists before trying to actually<br>
    call the method. <br>
    <br>
    Feature detection guarantees that the method is only called if it actually exists and fails gracefully,<br>
    without any exceptions being thrown, if the method doesn’t exist. <br>
     <br>
    Debugging in the Browser <br>
    Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them. <br>
    <br>
    The Trusty Alert <br>
    The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog at certain points in the code <br>
    Using alerts for debugging was the only option in the past, but JavaScript development has progressed <br>
    since then and their use is discouraged for debugging purposes today. <br>
    <br>
    Using the Console <br>
    Most modern JavaScript environments have a console object that provides a number of methods for logging information<br>
    and debugging. It’s not officially part of the ECMAScript specification, <br>
    but is well supported in all the major browsers and Node.js.  <br>
    <br>
    We’ve already seen and used the console.log() method. This can be used to log the value of variables at different stages <br>
    of the program, although it will not actually stop the execution of the program in the same way as alert() does. <br>
    <br>
    Debugging Tools <br>
    Most modern browsers also have a debugging tool that allows you to set breakpoints in your code that will pause it at certain points. <br>
    One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword. This will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause <br>
    the execution of the code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to. You can also hover over any variables to see <br>
    what value they hold at that point. The program can then be restarted by clicking on the play button. <br>
    <br>
    Error Objects <br>
    An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function.  <br>
    EvalError is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for backwards compatibility. <br>
    It was used to identify errors when using the global eval() function. <br>
    <br>
    RangeError is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.  <br>
    ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist. <br>
    For example, calling a function that hasn’t been defined.  <br>
    <br>
    SyntaxError is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax. TypeError is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; <br>
    for example, a string is used when a number is expected. <br>
    URIError is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI.  <br>
    <br>
    InternalError is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine. <br>
    A common cause of this is too much recursion. <br>
    <br>
    Throwing Exceptions <br>
    It’s also possible to throw your own exceptions using the throw statement. <br>
    This will allow for any problems in your code to be highlighted and dealt with, rather than lurk quietly in the background.  <br>
    <br>
    The throw statement can be applied to any JavaScript expression, causing the execution of the program to stop. <br>
    For example, all the following lines of code will cause a program to halt: <br>
    throw 2; <br>
    throw 'Up'; <br>
    throw { toys: 'out of pram' }; <br>
    <br>
    Exception Handling <br>
    It is possible to handle exceptions gracefully by catching the error. Any errors can be hidden from users, <br>
    but still identified. We can then deal with the error appropriately ― perhaps even ignore it ― and keep the program running. <br>

    Tests <br>
    A test can simply be a function that tests a piece of code runs as it should. <br>
    For example, we could test that the squareRoot() function that we wrote earlier returns the correct answer with the following function: <br>
    <br>
    function itSquareRoots4() { return squareRoot(4) === 2; } <br>
    <br>
    Here we’re comparing the result of squareRoot(4) with the number 2. This will return true if our function works as expected, which it does: <br>
    <br>
    itSquareRoots4(); << true  <br>
    <br>
    Test-driven Development <br>
    Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code. <br>
    These tests will initially fail, because there is no code to test. The next step is to write some code to make the tests pass. <br>
    After this, the code is refactored to make it faster, more readable, and remove any repetition. <br>
    <br>
    Workflow:  <br>
    <br>
        Write tests (that initially fail)  
        <br>
        Write code to pass the tests  
        <br>
        Refactor the code  
        <br>
        Test refactored code  
        <br>
        Write more tests for new features  
        <br>
        <br>
    This is often referred to as the “red-green-refactor” cycle of TDD, as failing tests usually show up as red, and tests that pass show as green. <br>
    <br>
    Jest<br>  
    Jest  is a TDD framework, created by Facebook, that has gained a lot of popularity recently. It makes it easy to create <br>
    and run tests by providing helper methods for common test assertions.  <br>
    <br>
    A code example used in the Quiz Ninja Project: <br>
    <br>
    use the console.log() method to log when some of the important functions are called. <br>
    console.log('start() invoked'); <br>
    console.log('ask() invoked');<br>
    console.log('check(event) invoked');<br>
    console.log('gameOver() invoked'); <br>
      <br>
    These declarations will log a message in the console when each method is invoked, <br>
    so we can see where the program is in its runtime. <br>
    There will be no impact on the player, though, as we’re just using the console. 
    <br>
    Example: <br>
    // welcome the user <br>
    alert("Welcome to Quiz Ninja!"); <br>
