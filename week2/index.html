    <h2>W02 Notes from JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</h2>
    <p>
        This article is based on personal notes from chapters 2, 3, and 4 from Javascript novice to ninja.<br>
        <br>
        Programming Basic<br>
        <br>
        In programming, a comment is a piece of code that is ignored by the language. It makes it easier for <br>
        anybody to read code. <br>
        <br>
        // this is a short comment<br>
        <br>
        /* This is a longer comment */<br>
        <br>
        The JavaScript syntax is C-style because of its similarities with the C programming language.<br>
        Statements end with a new line or semicolon; there's no need to use a semicolon because interpreters <br>
        use Automatic Semicolon Insertion; however, it is a good practice.<br>
        <br>
        const message = "Hello World!";<br>
        <br>
        A block is a series of statements that are collected together inside curly braces; <br>
        blocks don't need to be terminated by a semicolon. Whitespace in the code makes it neat and easy to read. <br>
        <br>
        There are reserved words for the use of JavaScript. Those words are not available to name variables, <br>
        functions, or objects. There are few words though that should be reserved but are not:<br>
        undefined<br>
        NaN<br>
        Infinity<br>
        <br>
        JavaScript has seven different data types. Six of them are primitive data types:<br>
        String<br>
        Symbol<br>
        Number<br>
        Boolean<br>
        Undefined<br>
        Null<br>
        <br>
        Objects are not primitive data, and these include arrays, functions, and object literals. <br>
        You can use typeof for finding the type of value, for example:<br>
        typeof "hello"<br>
        &lt;&lt; "string"<br>
        <br>
        Variables are used in programming languages to refer to a value stored in memory, <br>
        there are several ways to declare a variable, and to assign a value we use the = operator.<br>
        <br>
        const name = "Hello" // can't change<br>
        let name = "Hello" // can change<br>
        <br>
        You can assign multiple variables at the same time:<br>
        let x=3, y=4, z=5<br>
        <br>
        You should try to use const to declare most variables to avoid bugs.<br>
        <br>
        In previous versions of JavaScript variables were declared with var. The difference between var and const <br>
        or let is that the last two have block scope.<br>
        <br>
        Block scoped means that those variables only exits inside the block. Scope refers to where a constant or <br>
        variable is accessible by the program. <br>
        <br>
        Global scope means that it is accessible everywhere in the program, and is not considered a good practice, <br>
        try to use it to a minimum.<br>
        <br>
        Local scope use let or const, those are defined inside the block. <br>
        <br>
        You should name constants and variables with sensible names that describe what the variable represents. <br>
        The names can start with any upper or lower-case letter, an underscore, or dollar character; they can <br>
        contain numbers but not start with them. Also, remember that variable names are case sensitive.<br>
        <br>
        If you're using multiple words you may want to use Camel Case, it starts with lowercase and each new word <br>
        starts capitalized. Another option is to use underscores to separate but is not that convenient.<br>
        <br>
        A string is a set of characters, letters, and symbols. You can create strings using a constructor function:<br>
        <br>
        new String("hello")<br>
        &lt;&lt; [String: "hello"]<br>
        <br>
        If you want to escape a special character you may want to use the backslash.<br>
        <br>
        Primitive data types and objects have properties and methods. Properties are information about the object or value,<br>
         and methods perform an action on the object.<br>
         <br>
        Dot notation is used to access the properties of a string. <br>
        name.length // variable's length property<br>
        <br>
        A method is a task primitive data can perform, methods, and with parentheses. For example:<br>
        <br>
        toUpperCase() method<br>
        name.toUpperCase();<br>
        &lt;&lt; "NAME"<br>
        <br>
        There are a variety of methods:<br>
        toLowerCase();<br>
        charAt();<br>
        indexOf();<br>
        includes();<br>
        startWith();<br>
        concat();<br>
        trim();<br>
        <br>
        Template literals use the backtick character ` to deliminate the string. They allow interpolation, <br>
        which is an expression that can be inserted inside a string.<br>
        <br>
        const name = `Siri`; `Hello ${ name }!`; &lt;&lt; 'Hello Siri!' <br>
        <br>
        Symbols are a new primitive value in ES6. They create unique values, they don't have a literal form.<br>
        const uniqueID = Symbol();<br>
        <br>
        Numbers can be integers or floating-point numbers. If a number starts with 0x is hexadecimal. <br>
        JavaScript allows exponential notation 1e6 // 1 multiplied by 10 to the power 6<br>
        <br>
        Numbers also have methods:<br>
        toExponential()<br>
        toFixed()<br>
        toPrecision()<br>
        <br>
        Arithmetic Operations can be carried out in JavaScript. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, <br>
        exponentiation, or a remainder of a division.<br>
        <br>
        Arrays, Logic, and Loops<br>
        <br>
        An array is an ordered list of values, to create an array literal write a pair of square brackets:<br>
        const myArray = [];<br>
        <br>
        As I stated before arrays are not primitive values. Arrays use the index to access a specific value in an array. <br>
        heroes[0] = "Superman";<br>
        <br>
        Each item in an array works as a variable, you change the value using the assignment operator. <br>
        Unsued slots in the array are filled by the value undefined. Arrays contain a variety of data types and <br>
        empty array objects.<br>
        const mixedArray = [null, 1, [], "two, true"];<br>
        <br>
        The delete operator will remove an item from an array, but doesn't remove the place in the index,<br>
         that is replaced with undefined.<br>
         <br>
        There are different properties and methods for arrays. The length property or pop(), push(), <br>
        shift() and unshift() method, etc. Also, you can find if an array contains a particular value <br>
        using the indexOf() method. Multidimensional arrays are arrays of arrays.<br>
        <br>
        A set is a data structure that represents a collection of unique values, an empty set is creating<br>
        using the new operator:<br>
        const list = new Set();<br>
        You can add value:<br>
        list.add(1). Seth also has methods like the size() method or the has() method, this last one <br>
        checks if a value is in a set. To remove a value from a set use the delete() method.<br>
        <br>
        Maps are another data structure, they are similar to objects, but they are limited to using <br>
        strings for key values, and other differences.<br>
        <br>
        An empty map object uses the new operator and the Map() constructor.<br>
        const romanNumerals = new Map();<br>
        // add entries<br>
        romanNumeral.set(1, "I");<br>
        Some of the Map methods are get(), has(), delete() or clear().<br>
        <br>
        Logic<br>
        <br>
        If Statements are logical conditions that allow controlling the flow of a program.<br>
        if(condition){<br>
        // code to run if condition is true<br>
        }<br>
        <br>
        The else keyword can be used to add an alternative block of code to run.<br>
        if (condition){<br>
        // code to run if condition is true}<br>
        else{<br>
        //code to run if condition is false}<br>
        <br>
        The switch operator can be used to make code easier to read or follow.<br>
        switch (number) {<br>
         case 4:<br>
         console.log('You rolled a four'); break;<br>
         case 5:<br>
         console.log('You rolled a five'); break; <br>
         <br>
        They are different kinds of loops, that is code that will repeat over and over again <br>
        according to conditions. While loops, do... while loops, for loops, nested for loops, <br>
        and also you have to take care of infinite loops.<br>
        <br>
        Functions<br>
        <br>
        Functions are first-class objects, they behave the same way as all the other primitive data types.<br>
        function hello(){<br>
        console.log("Hello World!")}<br>
        <br>
        Invoking a function is to run the code inside of it. <br>
        hello(); <br>
        <br>
        All functions return a value, they use the word return as a statement. <br>
        A function that does not return anything will return undefined. <br>
        <br>
        Any parameters a function needs are set when the function is defined. <br>
        When a function is invoked it is provided with arguments.<br>
        <br>
        An arrow function is written like this:<br>
        const square = x => x*x;<br>
        const hello = () => alert("Hello World!");<br>
        <br>
        A function that is passed as an argument to another is a callback:<br>
        function sing(song,callback) { console.log(`I'm singing along to ${song}.`); callback();<br>
         } <br>
         <br>
    </p>
